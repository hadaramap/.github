# HADARAMAP APPLICATION PROJECT 
### AT THE QUEST FOR THE PLACES OF PRESENCE OF THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH SEYYIDINA MOUHAMMAD PSL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
According to Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: ''No one 
addresses me with greetings except that Allah SWT returns my soul to me until I return to him his greeting'' 
### CONTEXT AND PROJECT IDEA: 
Disciples of the Tariqa, staying in areas where the Tijjaaniy community is sparse, often face difficulties in 
finding a group with whom to perform the hadaratul jumua and the daily wirds. Mosques and prayer spaces 
in the West, Maghreb, and East do not systematically open their doors to the practice of zikr for the 
community. Collective zikr, with all its merits and blessings, is an essential element in the Tariqa's charters. 
Thus, the idea was born to launch a project aimed at creating a dynamic map of places where disciples of 
the path gather for zikr. This map will be integrated into a mobile application (Android & iPhone), allowing the 
faithful to locate the nearest group of fellow disciples to perform zikr in the community, wherever they are. 
Such a solution will not only contribute to better practice of the wird, but also promote integration into the 
Muhammadian Tijjaaniy community
